After skimming through OSM common map features, I feel that among all the cities I've visited, I should be able to find 
almost every type of the features in the area. Because although HK is cramped with highrises, it's actually consisted of
many hills and coastlines. And the complex infrustructure (aeroway, aerialway, waterway, crossing and etc) that HK has 
should bring me some interesting findings. And the data size is big enough but not too big to crash my PC.

For exploration I use the map data of entire HK. But for auditing and cleaning I focus on Chungking Mansion whish is
located at the center of HK.
